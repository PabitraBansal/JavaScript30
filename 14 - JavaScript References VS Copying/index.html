			// You might think we can just do something like this:
			team[3] = "Ron";

			// however what happens when we update that array?
			console.log(team);
			console.log(players);

			// now here is the problem!
			console.log(team === players);

			// oh no - we have edited the original array too!
			// Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

			// So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
			// one way
			team2 = players.slice();
			console.log(team2 === players);

			// or create a new array and concat the old one in
			team3 = [].concat(players);

			// or use the new ES6 Spread
			tream4 = [...players];

			// now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

			// The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

			// with Objects
			const person = {
				name: "Wes Bos",
				age: 80,
			};

			// and think we make a copy:
			const captain = person;
			captain.name = "Pabitra Bansal";
			console.log(person);

			// how do we take a copy instead?
			const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });
			console.log(cap2);
			console.log(person);

			// We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

			// Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

				name: "Wes",

			// This will create a deep copy.
